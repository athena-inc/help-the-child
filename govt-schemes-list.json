    "shortDescription": "The Integrated Child Protection Scheme is based on the cardinal principle of \"protection of child rights\" and \"best interest of the child\".",
    "longDescription": "The existing institutions and programmes for child protection in India primarily stem from the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and National Plan of Action for Children 2005. ICPS brings several existing child protection programmes under one umbrella and integrates interventions for protecting children and preventing harm. It does not see 'child protection' as the exclusive responsibility of the DWCD but stresses that other sectors have a vital role to play. ICPS is expected to function as a Government- Civil Society Partnership scheme under the overall direction and responsibility of the Government. The scheme visualises a structure for providing services as well as monitoring and supervising the effective functioning of child protection system.",
